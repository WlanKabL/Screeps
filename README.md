# Screeps Private Server Script

Welcome to the **Screeps Private Server Script** repository! This project is designed for a private Screeps server where friends and colleagues collaborate, compete, and build awesome bases. The repository currently includes a simple yet powerful upload script (`upload.js`) to streamline your development workflow.

---

## **Features**

- **Automatic Code Upload**:  
  The `upload.js` script compiles TypeScript (if applicable) and automatically uploads all scripts into the Screeps local directory.  
  Once uploaded, the scripts are instantly available and executed in-game.

- **Seamless Workflow**:  
  Just run a single command, and your scripts are ready to run on your private Screeps server.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before using this project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)  
   Download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **TypeScript** (optional, for `.ts` file support)  
   Install it globally with:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Access to your private Screeps server**.

---

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/screeps-private-server-script.git
   cd screeps-private-server-script
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) If you're using TypeScript, ensure the `tsconfig.json` is properly set up.

---

### **Usage**

1. Place all your Screeps scripts into the `src/` directory.

2. Run the `upload.js` script to compile and upload your code to the local Screeps directory:
   ```bash
   node upload.js
   ```

3. Once uploaded, the scripts will automatically be available and executed in-game.

### **Directory Structure**

```
ðŸ“‚ screeps-private-server-script
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ src               # Your Screeps source code (e.g., main.ts)
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ dist              # Compiled JavaScript files (generated by TypeScript)
 â”œâ”€â”€ upload.js            # Script for uploading files
 â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Project dependencies and scripts
 â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
 â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # This readme file
```

---

## **How It Works**

The `upload.js` script performs the following steps:

1. **TypeScript Compilation**:  
   If your files are in TypeScript (`.ts`), it compiles them into JavaScript (`.js`) using the `tsc` command.

2. **File Upload**:  
   It moves the compiled JavaScript files (or raw JavaScript files) into the Screeps local directory located at:  
   `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Screeps\scripts\<YourServerInfo>\default`

3. **Ready for Execution**:  
   Once uploaded, the scripts are instantly executed by the Screeps game engine.

## **Future Plans**

Although the project is currently focused on automating uploads, here are some exciting future enhancements we are planning:

1. **Advanced Creep Management**:
   - Automate spawning, role assignments, and task prioritization.

2. **Dynamic Room Control**:
   - Automatically expand and manage new rooms.

3. **Combat Strategies**:
   - Implement offense and defense logic for tower management and attack units.

4. **Collaborative Features**:
   - Tools for better team coordination on the private server.
